# emoji-art-app

Emoji Art is a multiplatform (iOS, iPadOS, macOS) SwiftUI application that was used to follow along with Stanford's CS193P course, and was mainly created to finish the app and the homeworks in that course. This app takes advantage of Apple allowing single-target multidestination SwiftUI apps, namely between iOS and macOS.

This is a document app that allows the user to create "emoji art" by drag and dropping emojis onto a background. The background can be set via drag and drop from the web, photo library, pasteboard, or camera. 

This app takes advantage of:
- Combine
- DocumentGroup
- Custom document types
- UserDefaults
- Multithreading
- List
- Form
- NavigationStack
- Modality
- @EnvironmentObject
- Custom gestures
- SwiftUI & UIKit interoperability
- and more!
